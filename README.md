# MEPs


**Files:**
NYT data is the preprocessing of the New York Times text dataset. Sorts words by frequency so that you can trim the dataset down to the V-most common words. 

Synthetic data creates word-count data based on the LDA generative model.

mepfunctions includes the coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) update algorithm, the simplified string method with a CAVI (i.e. natural gradient) step, and computation of the ELBO. 

implementation gives the running of these functions to obtain MEPs.
