NYT data is the preprocessing of the New York Times text dataset. Sorts words by frequency so that you can trim the dataset down to the V-most common words. 
Synthetic data creates word-count data based on the LDA generative model.
mepfunctions.py includes the coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI) update algorithm, the simplified string method with a CAVI (i.e. natural gradient) step, and computation of the ELBO.
